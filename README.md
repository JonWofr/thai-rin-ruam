# Thai Rin Ruam

The website is the digital presence of the renowned Thai restaurant Thai Rin Ruam based in Kevelaer, Germany.


## Website

https://thairinruam.de/


## The challenge

The challenge was to renew their existing website. This primarily included a modern redesign, making the website responsive and the functionality to change the menu and the news section by Thai Rin Ruam themselves at any given time.


## The result 

I created a web application with the help of Angular based on a design mockup. The website is divided into two spaces, one for users, one for admins. The former displays information like news, all available dishes, address information etc. The latter is used to provide the functionality for authenticated users to dynamically change dishes and news which enabled Thai Rin Ruam to make changes to the website themselves after project handover.


## Technologies
